<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Study Advice:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">——————</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Before Leetcode get 1 book.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Go through MOST of Cracking the Coding Interview. I say most because there are sections (like the one on math) that are increasingly less important for CS interviews.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Follow the entirety of the book taking copious notes and attempting EVERY problem (NO SHORTCUTS!). You can think of the book as essentially your version of taking college level DS and Algo courses. Once you complete the book and problems you will have benefitted twofold:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">1. You will have practiced actual interview problems</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">2. You will have a good framework for your preparation</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">3. You will have 90% of the fundamentals down for all possible coding problems</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">4. You should have / will have identified your weaknesses and know where to focus your study.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Follow the book’s guidelines on soft skills, resume prep, study timeline as well. Use it holistically as it was meant, it is an excellent resource.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I know you prefer online resources but this book is the most well rounded comprehensive interview prep book (ie it covers a lot of ground relatively succinctly that you will need for interviews, including system design).</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Unfortunately I don’t believe this book is always sufficient prep by itself. So after you work through it your next step is to:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">1. Get leetcode premium</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">2. Take the Grokking the System Design course</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Use Leetcode Premium specifically to do problems that are tagged to companies you are interested in and to do additional practice on areas you are weak at (ie if you suck at Dynamic Programming sort by all top rated DP problems and do them from easiest to hardest to build your intuition).</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Use Grokking the System Design Interview to cover ground not covered in Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI). CTCI has a lot of great breadth but falls short of depth in some areas, this is one of them.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Your last step / piece of overarching advice here is to create a timeline of when you would like to interview and work backwards. Once you are starting to seriously think about interviewing it is time to both practice problems for time and to do mock interviews (interviewing.io etc). Do your prep only with a pen / paper and a whiteboard (if that is the medium you expect to be interviewing in) and work on time.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Once you hit the interviewing stage it is usually time to start scheduling some interviews you aren’t as psyched about for a test run. You need to get used to performing with interview jitters as well.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So to recap:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">CTCI (maybe 3 months if no prior knowledge) -&gt; Leetcode + Grokking (a month to start shoring things up) -&gt; Keep Leetcoding / Practice + Doing mocks 1/2 times a week (a month) -&gt; assess your progress if you’re ready to start interviewing -&gt; Start doing interviews with lower priority companies -&gt; Schedule interviews with FAANG</span></p>
